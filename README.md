# Multi-Objective-Evolutionary-Optimization-of-Crypto-Assets

Project Description

Crypto Asset Management (CAM) manages a portfolio of cryptocurrencies to maximize returns and minimize risk. Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization (EMO) is used to find optimal solutions to multi-objective problems. In this project, EMO will be used to optimize a portfolio of cryptocurrencies by using risk, diversification, and returns as objectives. We will optimize the assets using SMS-EMOA, a multi-objective selection algorithm based on dominated hypervolume. This will be very useful for investors to make future investments.

In this project, we will cover the following:

Load the data for different cryptocurrencies.
Create interactive plots for data analysis.
Use an evolutionary algorithm to minimize the risks and maximize the returns.
